# Word Frequency Analyzer For CloudBash
This tool extracts the top 10 most frequently used words from any webpage URL entered by the user. Itâ€™s designed to quickly analyze text frequency, which can be useful for understanding content focus and keyword density.

For this project, I used Express.js to build the backend server, Axios to handle HTTP requests, and Cheerio for HTML parsing. On the frontend, I used React to create an interactive user interface, allowing users to input URLs and view results in a clean format.
